# authorization header
for some requests the juice shop app checks if the user that is authenticated, it is doing it by reading the value of the variable `Authorization` at the header

you will also need to send this information on the requests that you will do by using the js files, in order to copy do it you need to follow the steps below:

- after you log in with a user
- open the *network* tab of your browser and navigate at the app
- notice that at the request there is a header entry named `Authorization`, that is the [jwt token](https://jwt.io/) the app is using to check if the user is authenticated
- copy that entry `Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1...`
- paste the content of this value at the file `auth.js`

# broken anti automation
## captcha bypass
游동游동游동

*submit 10 or more customer feedbacks within 10 seconds*

### howto

post one simple feedback and check the request at the *network* tab

notice that at the data you are sending you are also sending the `captchaId` and also the `captcha` that is the value of it, that means that the captcha validation will be done at the server side, by using this `captchaId`, as we aren't changing its value we are good to go

the result will be
```
Invalid password 123456
Invalid password 123456789
Invalid password password
Invalid password qwerty
Invalid password 111111
Invalid password 12345678
Invalid password abc123
Invalid password 1234567
Invalid password 12345

```javascript
encodeURIComponent('assets/public/images/uploads/游떂-#zatschi-#whoneedsfourlegs-1572600969477.jpg')
```

the result will be
